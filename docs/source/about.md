# About
[argosim](https://github.com/ARGOS-telescope/argosim) is a python package for radio interferometric observation simulations and image reconstruction. It is developed as part of the [ARGOS](https://argos-telescope.eu) project, a European initiative to build a next-generation, sustainable radio interferometer.

This software is developed at the [CosmoStat](https://www.cosmostat.org/) laboratory, CEA, Paris-Saclay, in collaboration with the [ARGOS](https://argos-telescope.eu) project.


## üõ†Ô∏è Development
We use continuous integration to maintain code quality and robustness:
* Unit tests with `pytest`
* Linting with `black` and `isort`
* Documentation building with `sphinx`
