# Argosim GUI

`argosim` provides an optional PyQt6-based GUI for interactive simulations. It supports array configuration, uv-coverage visualization, and imagingâ€”all without writing code.

> Ideal for education, outreach, and rapid prototyping.

To launch the GUI and have access to the custom templates you need to clone the `argosim` repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARGOS-telescope/argosim.git
cd argosim
```

## Installation
Running the GUI requires the `pyQt6` package, which can be installed with the following command:
```
pip install "argosim[gui]"
```

## Launching the GUI
For opening the GUI, run the following command:
```
python app/argosim-gui.py
```
