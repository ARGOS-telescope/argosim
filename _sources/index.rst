Argosim
=======

This is the first page of the Argosim documentation.Argosim is a modular and lightweight package for radio interferometric simulations. 
It is coded in Python and has a JAX computational backend.

This software was developed at the [CosmoStat](https://www.cosmostat.org/) laboratory, CEA, Paris-Saclay, in the context of the [ARGOS](https://argos-telescope.eu) telescope.

Argosim provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and visualization of simulations. 
The GUI is mainly intended for educational purposes and to facilitate the understanding of radio interferometric simulations, along with the use of Argosim.
